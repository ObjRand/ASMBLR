                <h1>About ASMBLR</h1>
                <h3 class="about">ASMBLR is a language I made because I was bored one day and decided, "Hey, why not?".
It took around 1 week and was pretty fun to make. Of course, I had a bit of experience making interpreted languages in python before,
but this was the best language i made so far. It's a weird in syntax and currently lacks proper error handling, 
but unlike my languages prior, this one is turing complete and the code is TOO bad :)
